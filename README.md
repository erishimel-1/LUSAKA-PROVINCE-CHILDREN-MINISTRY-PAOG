✨ Children's Ministry – Growing Faith, One Child at a Time
Welcome to our Children’s Ministry — a joyful space where young hearts discover the love of Jesus through stories, songs, and fun activities! Our mission is to partner with families to nurture a strong, faith-filled foundation in every child.

We believe every child is uniquely loved by God and has a purpose. Through age-appropriate Bible lessons, creative crafts, interactive worship, and memory verses, we guide children to grow spiritually, emotionally, and socially — all in a safe, caring environment.

Whether it’s Sunday school, special events, or resources for home learning, we’re here to walk this journey of faith with your family.
